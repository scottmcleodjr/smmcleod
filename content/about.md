Hello, **I'm Scott**.  I'm a Pittsburgh-based software engineer and team lead at Solventum.

**At work**, I solve at the nexus of DevOps, site reliability, and cloud FinOps.  My days can move between developing new features for backend services, maintaining enterprise software deployments in the cloud, and working with engineering teams to design cost-efficient architectures.  I'm especially passionate about bringing elegance and maintainability to the projects I work on.

**My personal projects** include open-source code in Go, Common Lisp, Java, and other languages.  Several of these projects are tools for amateur radio logging and morse code (CW) communication.  There are also cellular automata, a lambda calculus library for Common Lisp, and other odd things.

**Amateur radio** is a long-standing interest.  I have been licensed as K3GDS since April 2016.  Under that call, I've operated from two primary and several portable station locations in Western Pennsylvania.  I have also operated for W3YI (University of Pittsburgh) in the ARRL DX CW and WPX RTTY contests.

**Woodworking** with hand tools is my most recent passion.  Using low-tech methods and centuries-old techniques to create objects I can see and hold is a meaningful counterpoint to my day's work.
